# Hello-World
First repository for class exercises and projects.
This is a text file with info about each exercise or project.
I am taking an HTML5/CSS3 bootcamp course, an Interactive Python course, and will soon be starting a javaScript bootcamp course. Just to see what an Ivy League compsci course is like, I am also taking Harvard's CS50.
